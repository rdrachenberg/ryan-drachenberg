## Token Minting and Burning Mechanism

- **Minting NFTs**: When a user accumulates at least one base unit (10^18) of the ERC20 tokens, an NFT is automatically minted to their address. This process follows as the user continues to accumulate each subsequent base unit of tokens.
  
- **Burning NFTs**: If the user's token balance falls below a base unit threshold, the most recently minted NFT is burned. This mechanism is similar to the one employed in ERC404, ensuring a dynamic balance between the base tokens and their corresponding NFTs.

## Mirror Contract Compliance and Functionality

- **ERC721 Compliance**: The mirror contract adheres strictly to the ERC721 standard, ensuring compatibility with all protocols supporting ERC721 tokens.
  
- **Automated NFT Minting and Burning**: As the base ERC20 tokens are transferred, the corresponding mirrored NFTs are minted and burned automatically, maintaining a consistent representation of ownership.

## DN404's Innovation and Goal

- **Native Fractionalization**: DN404's primary objective is to introduce a token standard that embodies both NFT and fractionalization properties. This innovation, initially seen in ERC404, enables users to trade portions of NFTs directly, without intermediaries.
  
- **Beyond ERC1155**: While some may compare DN404 to ERC1155 tokens, DN404 stands apart by enabling NFTs to be traded both on dedicated NFT exchanges and decentralized exchanges (DEXes). This dual functionality enhances liquidity for NFT projects.

## Code Optimization and Risk Disclaimer

- **Code Optimization**: The code has undergone extensive optimization, thanks to @optimizoor, known for Solady and ERC721A contributions.
  
- **Disclaimer**: The code is yet to undergo a formal audit. Users are advised to use it at their own risk, and the developers do not assume liability for any potential exploits.
