# The Rise of On-Chain AI Agents

By June 2025, the worlds of AI and blockchain are colliding in fascinating ways. One of the most talked-about trends: on-chain AI agents.

## What Are They?

These are autonomous bots powered by machine learning models that live on-chain, interact with smart contracts, and execute tasks without human input. Think trading bots, governance participants, or even decentralized customer service reps.

## Use Cases Emerging

- **DeFi trading.** Bots that adjust liquidity positions dynamically.  
- **DAO governance.** Agents that analyze proposals and vote.  
- **NFTs.** Characters in blockchain games that evolve with player interaction.  

## Risks and Questions

Autonomy raises ethical and technical questions. What if an AI agent makes a bad trade? Who is liable? Could AI collude in governance systems? These aren’t sci-fi hypotheticals—they’re live issues.

## Why It Matters

The rise of on-chain AI agents blurs the line between humans and machines in decentralized systems. June 2025 may be remembered as the month they started to move from theory to reality.
