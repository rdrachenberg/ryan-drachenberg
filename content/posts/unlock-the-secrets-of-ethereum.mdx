The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a crucial component of the Ethereum network, responsible for executing smart contracts and maintaining the state of the Ethereum blockchain. When it comes to the memory location in the context of the EVM, it's important to understand how the EVM handles data and storage.
## Memory in the EVM
The EVM has a volatile memory space where data can be stored temporarily during the execution of a smart contract. This memory is akin to the RAM in a computer. It is created afresh for each transaction and gets erased after the transaction is completed. This memory is linear and can be expanded as needed by the smart contract during its execution, but it cannot persist data between transactions.

## Storage in the EVM
In contrast to memory, storage in the EVM is non-volatile and is used to store the state of smart contracts. This is akin to a computer's hard drive. Each smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network has its own storage space, where it can store data persistently. Unlike memory, storage data remains intact between transactions and is written to the Ethereum blockchain, making it permanent and unchangeable (unless modified by the smart contract's code).

## Stack in the EVM
The EVM also has a stack, which is used for evaluations and control flow. The stack has a maximum size of 1024 elements and is used for performing operations like adding, multiplying, and so on. Data can be pushed to or popped from the stack during the execution of a smart contract.

## Gas Costs
It's important to note that both memory and storage operations in the EVM come with associated gas costs. Gas is the fee required to conduct a transaction or execute a smart contract on the Ethereum network. Operations involving storage are generally more expensive than those involving memory due to the permanent nature of storage.

## Blockchain State
The overall state of the Ethereum blockchain (including all account balances, smart contract code, and smart contract storage) is stored in a data structure known as a Merkle Patricia Tree. This structure enables efficient and secure verification of the blockchain's contents.

In summary, the EVM's memory location refers to the volatile space used for temporary data storage during transaction execution, while persistent data storage is achieved through the blockchain's state, specifically in the storage associated with each smart contract. The EVM's architecture ensures efficient execution of smart contracts while maintaining the integrity and state of the Ethereum blockchain.
