Bitcoin has reached a significant milestone, crossing the $70,000 mark and coming close to its all-time high. This recent surge, fueled by U.S. election excitement, has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs position as the dominant crypto asset and brought renewed interest from investors worldwide. Here‚Äôs a look at what this means for Bitcoin, the broader crypto market, and the next steps for investors.



### üìà Election Day Volatility Ahead for Bitcoin

According to cycles experts, Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally wasn‚Äôt expected to happen this quickly. Yet, excitement around the U.S. presidential election has driven Bitcoin‚Äôs price upward, putting it within reach of its record high. However, investors should brace for potential **volatility** as Election Day approaches. Experts using **Crypto Timing Models** indicate a key low around November 5, suggesting the possibility of temporary price swings as election results unfold. For investors, this means staying prepared and viewing any corrections as buying opportunities rather than reasons to panic.

### üîç Altcoin Rally Likely to Follow Bitcoin‚Äôs Lead

For altcoins, it seems that we may have to wait for Bitcoin to solidify its position. Market analysts point out that most top altcoins are still struggling to break through critical price levels and will likely remain subdued until Bitcoin surpasses its all-time high. Once that happens, experts suggest investors should watch for a reversal in **Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance** ‚Äî the measure of Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market cap. A drop in dominance could signal the start of ‚Äúaltseason,‚Äù a period when altcoins experience significant growth relative to Bitcoin.

This trend is particularly relevant for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. When Bitcoin dominates the market, funds tend to flow into it rather than altcoins. However, once dominance reverses, altcoins often rally, providing opportunities for impressive returns. 

### üìä Key Indicators to Watch for the Next Bull Run

Market experts have highlighted three key indicators to help investors gauge when the market might enter a full-scale bull run. One of these indicators is **Bitcoin‚Äôs spot CVD** (Cumulative Volume Delta), which helps track buying and selling pressures. By monitoring spot CVD and other metrics, investors can gain insight into whether market sentiment is leaning bullish or bearish.

For those eager to dive deeper, tracking these indicators independently is recommended. It‚Äôs essential to approach altcoins with caution ‚Äî not every altcoin will benefit equally from a bull run, and some may not rally at all. Conducting thorough research and examining each project‚Äôs fundamentals and leadership are crucial for selecting potential winners.



### üõ†Ô∏è Governance in Focus: Uniswap‚Äôs DAO Drama

</div>

Beyond price action, governance is a growing factor in the crypto space, and **Uniswap‚Äôs DAO** (decentralized autonomous organization) offers a cautionary tale. UNI token holders, who participate in governing Uniswap‚Äôs protocol, are facing a **power struggle**. Large venture capital firms are consolidating power within Uniswap‚Äôs DAO, creating tensions among token holders. Analysts note that this scenario highlights the importance of balanced governance structures to maintain a truly decentralized organization.

This issue extends beyond Uniswap, as many DAOs struggle to maintain fair governance. Some experts propose solutions that could benefit not only Uniswap but also other DAOs in the crypto ecosystem by limiting centralized influence and encouraging diverse participation. For investors, understanding a project‚Äôs governance structure can provide insight into its resilience and long-term success potential.

### üìù Preparing for Altcoin Season and Beyond

As the market watches Bitcoin‚Äôs next moves, altcoin investors should be prepared to act once Bitcoin breaks its all-time high. Here are some steps to consider:

- **Research Your Favorite Altcoins**: Look into projects with strong fundamentals and governance structures. Use tools like crypto ratings to help identify potential winners.
- **Monitor Key Indicators**: Keep an eye on Bitcoin‚Äôs spot CVD, dominance, and overall market sentiment to gauge the likelihood of a sustained rally.
- **Diversify and Plan Ahead**: While Bitcoin is currently leading the charge, altcoins with solid fundamentals are likely to follow. Planning a diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks.

With Bitcoin‚Äôs strength continuing to grow, this could be an exciting time for both Bitcoin and altcoin investors. Whether you‚Äôre a long-term holder or an active trader, staying informed and prepared is the best way to navigate the opportunities and volatility ahead.
