# Are Meme Coins Here to Stay in 2025?

Love them or hate them, meme coins refuse to die. July 2025 has made it clear: they’re not just noise—they’re part of crypto culture.

## The Case for Staying Power

- **Community.** Meme coins are grassroots movements disguised as assets.  
- **Liquidity funnels.** They often onboard new users who later explore DeFi and NFTs.  
- **Experimentation.** Some meme projects are launching real products and DAOs.  

## The Skeptics’ View

Critics argue meme coins are still a distraction, siphoning capital from serious projects. They remain volatile, risky, and often short-lived.

## The Truth?

Maybe meme coins don’t need to be “serious” to matter. Their cultural weight ensures they’ll always have a place in the ecosystem—even if just as entry points.
