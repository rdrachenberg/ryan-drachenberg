# Crypto Summer 2025: Early Signs

If you’ve been around since 2020, you remember DeFi Summer. June 2025 has that same electric feeling. Memes are flowing, TVL is climbing, and the markets are heating up.

## Why Now?

- **Ethereum’s upgrade.** Lower gas fees are onboarding new users.  
- **Bitcoin halving momentum.** The supply shock is fueling bullish sentiment.  
- **Altcoin season.** Layer-1s and Layer-2s are rallying in tandem.  

## Cultural Vibes

Crypto Twitter is loud again. Telegram groups are buzzing. Even mainstream media is cautiously covering the market’s rise. The mood isn’t euphoric yet, but it’s shifting.

## Can It Last?

Every summer boom risks overheating. But builders are shipping real products this time—NFT infra, DeFi protocols, gaming economies. If sustained, this could be the beginning of a cycle that makes 2020 look small.
