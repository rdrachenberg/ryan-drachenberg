If you’ve been around since 2020, you remember DeFi Summer. June 2025 has that same electric feeling. Memes are flowing, TVL is climbing, and the markets are heating up.

## Why Now?

- **Ethereum’s upgrade.** Lower gas fees are onboarding new users.  
- **Bitcoin halving momentum.** The supply shock is fueling bullish sentiment.  
- **Altcoin season.** Layer-1s and Layer-2s are rallying in tandem.  

## Cultural Vibes

Crypto Twitter is loud again. Telegram groups are buzzing. Even mainstream media is cautiously covering the market’s rise. The mood isn’t euphoric yet, but it’s shifting.

## Can It Last?

Every summer boom risks overheating. But builders are shipping real products this time—NFT infra, DeFi protocols, gaming economies. If sustained, this could be the beginning of a cycle that makes 2020 look small.
