Enter Blockscan, a revolutionary search engine designed to simplify your journey through the decentralized web. Officially launched by the same team behind Etherscan, Blockscan enables users to explore websites on .eth, .crypto, and .zil domains, with many more to come.

Blockscan aims to be the Google of the decentralized web. Whether you're curious about a specific blockchain address or just browsing, Blockscan has you covered. The platform allows users to kickstart their journey by browsing through a directory of 150 known websites. This feature provides a curated entry point into the vast and often fragmented world of decentralized sites, ensuring users can easily find relevant and interesting content.
