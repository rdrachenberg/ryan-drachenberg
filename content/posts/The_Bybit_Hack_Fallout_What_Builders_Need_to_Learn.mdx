# The Bybit Hack Fallout: What Builders Need to Learn

Early February brought one of the year’s biggest shocks: the Bybit exchange hack. Millions were drained, regulators pounced, and the crypto community was left asking—how did this happen again?

## A Familiar Story

The details read like déjà vu. A compromised private key. Inadequate multisig protections. Attackers moved fast, and the response was too slow. Despite years of high-profile hacks, some of the same mistakes keep repeating.

## Builders, Pay Attention

If you’re building in crypto, the Bybit hack is your wake-up call. Security isn’t optional—it’s existential. Lessons include:

- **Use multisig or MPC.** One key should never hold the kingdom.  
- **Real-time monitoring.** Seconds matter in an attack. Automation saves money.  
- **User funds = sacred.** Exchanges are custodians. Transparency and communication build trust.  

## The Market Response

Short-term, the hack dented confidence. Bybit volumes dropped, and competitors seized the moment. Long-term, it may accelerate adoption of decentralized exchanges and self-custody solutions.

## The Bigger Picture

Every hack is painful, but it also forces progress. Just as Mt. Gox led to better custodians and Terra’s collapse sparked stablecoin scrutiny, Bybit’s failure will push the industry toward better standards.
