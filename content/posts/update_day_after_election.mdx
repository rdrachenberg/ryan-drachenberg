### üìà **Bitcoin Tests $70,000 Amid Election-Driven Volatility**

Bitcoin is once again testing the **$70,000 level** as the U.S. presidential election fuels volatility. Investors are closely watching market reactions as the election outcome approaches.

### üìä **Record Outflows from US Spot Bitcoin ETFs**

In a surprising turn, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded the **second-largest outflow of funds** in their history, totaling $541 million. Analysts believe that this outflow could be tied to election-related uncertainty, as investors pull back in response to potential regulatory changes. ETFs have been a significant gateway for institutional investors into Bitcoin, and such large outflows suggest that the market is bracing for short-term volatility. However, some experts argue that these outflows may be temporary, with capital returning once election outcomes and regulatory stances become clearer.
