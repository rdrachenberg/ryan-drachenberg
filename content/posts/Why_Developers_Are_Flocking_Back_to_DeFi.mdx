# Why Developers Are Flocking Back to DeFi

DeFi was supposed to be dead after 2022’s meltdowns. Yet here we are in May 2025, and developers are flocking back to decentralized finance with renewed energy.

## What’s Changed?

- **Better security.** Rug pulls and hacks are less frequent thanks to battle-tested frameworks.  
- **Real users.** Farmers may still chase yields, but growing numbers are using DeFi for payments, remittances, and credit.  
- **Cross-chain tooling.** Protocols can now deploy across chains seamlessly, capturing broader liquidity.  

## The Developer Mood

Hackathons are bustling again, and venture funding for DeFi projects has surged. Builders are focusing on sustainability rather than flashy short-term rewards.

## Final Thoughts

The return of developers might be the most bullish signal of all. Prices can pump and dump, but when builders show up, real value gets created.
