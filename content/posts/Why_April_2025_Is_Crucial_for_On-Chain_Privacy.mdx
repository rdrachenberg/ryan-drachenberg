# Why April 2025 Is Crucial for On-Chain Privacy

Privacy has always been cryptoâ€™s thorny issue. This April, the debate has reached a fever pitch as regulators eye privacy-enhancing tech and developers push back.

## The State of Play

- **ZK tech is maturing.** Zero-knowledge proofs now enable private transactions on Ethereum rollups and Solana sidechains.  
- **Regulators are nervous.** The U.S. Treasury has hinted at crackdowns, citing concerns about money laundering.  
- **Builders are defiant.** Privacy-focused protocols argue that financial confidentiality is a human right.  

## Why April Matters

New proposals for privacy-enhanced rollups are launching this month, and major DeFi protocols are considering integration. At the same time, European regulators are drafting laws that could heavily restrict private transactions.

## The Dilemma

Crypto is at a crossroads: embrace privacy and risk bans, or compromise for compliance and risk losing the very ethos of decentralization.
