title: "DeFi Protocol Security: Still an Achilles Heel"

For all the progress in DeFi, July 2025 has shown one thing clearly: security remains its weakest point. Hacks and exploits are still draining millions, raising questions about whether DeFi can ever be truly safe.

## Recent Incidents

Several high-profile protocols faced flash loan attacks and oracle manipulation. Despite audits, vulnerabilities keep surfacing. Attackers are getting smarter, and defenses aren’t keeping pace.

## Why It’s Hard

- **Complexity.** Composability creates attack surfaces.  
- **Incentives.** Fast shipping often trumps careful auditing.  
- **Decentralization.** No central authority means slower crisis response.  

## Potential Solutions

- **Formal verification.** Making code mathematically provable.  
- **Insurance protocols.** Spreading risk across communities.  
- **AI monitoring.** Leveraging machine learning to spot anomalies in real time.  

## The Bigger Picture

DeFi’s promise is immense, but without stronger security, it risks undermining itself. July 2025 reminds us: in crypto, trust is built on code—and code still breaks.
