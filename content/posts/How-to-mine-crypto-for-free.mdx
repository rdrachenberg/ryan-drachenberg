# Guide to Mining HOT: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction to HOT
HOT plays a pivotal role in the NEAR ecosystem, especially within Telegram. Its use of meta-transactions enables a variety of blockchain activities including gaming, transfers, and genuine blockchain transactions. HOT is unique as it's the first fungible token (FT) mirroring the functionality of native Layer 1 (L1) blockchain tokens.

Looking ahead, HOT's utility is set to expand beyond the NEAR Ecosystem. With the advent of Chain Abstraction in the second quarter of 2024, HOT will be compatible with Ethereum and similar networks, enhancing its transactional capabilities.

For a primer on basic wallet functions, refer to the wallet tutorial section.

## Getting Started with HOT Mining
To initiate mining, simply set up your wallet. The mining process automatically begins when you claim your initial, complimentary HOT.

## Understanding the Mining Process
Mining continues until the Storage capacity is reached.

### Storage Management
- At the onset, you start with minimal Storage capacity, requiring attention every 2 hours to prevent mining interruption. The Storage level indicates when HOT mining pauses until you claim the mined HOT.
- Initially, Storage sustains 2 hours of mining. However, you can extend this duration by using HOT to enhance Storage capacity.

### Storage Levels
1. Wooden Storage: 2 hours (Free)
2. Metal Storage: 3 hours (0.2 HOT)
3. Modular Storage: 4 hours (0.5 HOT)
4. Liquid Storage: 6 hours (1 HOT)
5. Titanium Storage: 12 hours (4 HOT)
6. Gold Storage: 24 hours (10 HOT)

## Boosting Mining Speed
Enhancing your HOT mining speed is crucial and achievable through several methods.

### Fireplace Upgrade
- The Fireplace dictates basic mining speed, which can be upgraded using HOT.
- Fireplace Levels:
   1. Wood Firespace: 0.01 HOT/hour (Free)
   2. Stone Firespace: 0.015 HOT/hour (0.2 HOT)
   3. Gas Firespace: 0.02 HOT/hour (1 HOT)
   4. Neon Firespace: 0.025 HOT/hour (2 HOT)
   5. Neon Multi-Firespace: 0.03 HOT/hour (5 HOT)
   6. Gold Fireplace: 0.05 HOT/hour (15 HOT)

### Wood Usage
- Wood serves as a significant booster for active users engaged in the NEAR Protocol ecosystem. Completing various missions yields multipliers for HOT mining.

### Referral System
- A potent strategy for mining HOT is through referrals. A two-tier referral system rewards you with 20% extra HOT post each claim by a direct referral and 5% from their referrals.
- To invite friends, simply use the "Friends" feature and share the referral link.

## Claiming HOT
Claiming HOT officially records it on-chain. Each claim incurs a nominal network fee (gas), which is minimal due to NEAR Protocol's efficiency. Initially, you receive three free transactions, but subsequent HOT claims can be managed in three ways:
1. NEAR Top-Up: Add NEAR to your address.
2. Cover Gas Fee with HOT: Though feasible, using NEAR for network fees is more economical.
3. Complete Missions: Earn free transactions by completing specific missions.
