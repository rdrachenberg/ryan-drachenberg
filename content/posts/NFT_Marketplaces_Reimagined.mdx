# NFT Marketplaces Reimagined

The NFT market of May 2025 looks nothing like the bubble of 2021. Gone are the days of endless PFP projects and speculative mania. Today’s NFT marketplaces are leaner, smarter, and surprisingly practical.

## Key Shifts

1. **Utility-driven NFTs.** Tokens are now tied to memberships, events, and in-game items.  
2. **Cross-chain integration.** Marketplaces let users buy Solana, Ethereum, and Polygon NFTs in one place.  
3. **Dynamic royalties.** Artists can experiment with flexible royalty structures, regaining control over monetization.  

## Winners and Losers

OpenSea has reinvented itself with multi-chain support, but it’s facing tough competition from Blur, Magic Eden, and even decentralized protocols that allow P2P swaps.

## The Big Picture

NFTs are no longer about “JPEG speculation.” They’re quietly becoming infrastructure for digital ownership.
