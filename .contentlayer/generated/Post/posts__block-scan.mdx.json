Enter Blockscan, a revolutionary search engine designed to simplify your journey through the decentralized web. Officially launched by the same team behind Etherscan, Blockscan enables users to explore websites on .eth, .crypto, and .zil domains, with many more to come.\n\nBlockscan aims to be the Google of the decentralized web. Whether you're curious about a specific blockchain address or just browsing, Blockscan has you covered. The platform allows users to kickstart their journey by browsing through a directory of 150 known websites. This feature provides a curated entry point into the vast and often fragmented world of decentralized sites, ensuring users can easily find relevant and interesting content.\n\nOne of Blockscan's standout features is its ability to cross-reference addresses across multiple chains. With just a click on the Blockscan icon, users can see if an address appears in up to 17 different EVM chains. This powerful tool provides unprecedented visibility into the decentralized ecosystem, making it easier than ever to track and verify blockchain activities.\n\nIn essence, Blockscan is not just a search engine but a comprehensive explorer for the distributed web. By simplifying access and enhancing transparency, Blockscan is poised to become an indispensable tool for blockchain enthusiasts and newcomers alike.
