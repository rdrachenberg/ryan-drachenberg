    "raw": "\nWhile political headlines and Bitcoin price action stole the spotlight this November, something more subtle—but potentially more important—is happening under the surface: DeFi is quietly coming back to life.\n\n## The Numbers Tell a Story\n\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) across major protocols has been climbing steadily since early Q3. It’s not the manic parabolic surge of 2020’s “DeFi Summer,” but rather a slow, deliberate build. Uniswap v4, Curve’s new AMM modules, and lending protocols like Aave are reporting steady inflows, with fewer of the wild yield-farming gimmicks that defined the last cycle.\n\nStablecoins are the backbone of this rebound. With U.S. election volatility and global macro uncertainty, stablecoin demand has surged. USDC and USDT remain dominant, but decentralized alternatives like DAI and newer entrants are seeing renewed interest.\n\n## Lessons Learned From the Past\n\nDeFi in 2020 was about experimentation—flashy returns, unaudited contracts, and a lot of rugs. Late 2024 DeFi feels wiser. Protocols are emphasizing sustainability, security, and governance.\n\n- **Security first.** Audit firms are busier than ever, and insurance protocols like Nexus Mutual are gaining traction again.\n- **Governance maturity.** DAOs aren’t just memes anymore. Treasury management and risk frameworks are a priority.\n- **Composability done right.** Instead of spaghetti protocols chasing hype, modular design and interoperability are leading.\n\n## The Builders’ Mood\n\nDevelopers are optimistic but measured. They’re building products that can stand regulatory scrutiny and real-world use. On Discord and GitHub, conversations are less about meme farming and more about UX, compliance, and long-term value.\n\nThis is DeFi growing up.\n\n## Looking Into 2025\n\nIf this trend continues, early 2025 could mark the start of DeFi’s “second wave.” The excitement of 2020 may never be replicated—but perhaps that’s a good thing. A healthier, more sustainable ecosystem might be even more valuable than another round of hype-driven euphoria.\n\n---\n",
