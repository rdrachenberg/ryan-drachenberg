Here are some of the top updates from this month:\n\n### ðŸ›  Major Blockchain Upgrades\n\nSeveral blockchain networks, including Flow, Polkastarter, and Dusk Network, underwent significant upgrades this month. Notably, on **September 4**, Flow completed its *Crescendo Network* upgrade, designed to boost its scalability and attract developers to its ecosystem. Polkastarter also launched its *V4* version, enhancing its platform's features and attracting more project developers [source](https://blockchainreporter.net). Meanwhile, Dusk Network celebrated the launch of its mainnet on **September 20**, a crucial step towards decentralization.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src='https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmSn2anWjMYCPjX6Mj8YAidyechSBTdsrBiUnpYk2zTPs2' width='500' height='500' />\n    Image credit: https://flow.com/core-protocol\n</p>\n\n### ðŸ’¼ Regulatory Movements\n\nThe regulatory landscape in the crypto space also saw some important developments. On **September 12**, the SEC settled a case with **eToro USA**, resulting in a $1.5 million penalty for offering unregistered crypto asset securities. As part of the agreement, eToro will limit the crypto assets available to US customers, including Bitcoin, Ether, and Bitcoin Cash [source](https://dlapiper.com). The **CFTC** also issued charges against **Uniswap Labs** for illegal digital asset derivatives trading, resulting in a $175,000 penalty. \n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src='https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2022/05/10/15/08/bitcoin-7187347_1280.png' width='500' height='500' />\n</p>\n\n### ðŸ“ˆ Market Trends & Predictions\n\nDespite some bearish movements earlier in the month, **Bitcoin** rebounded to around $58.4K, showing signs of recovery after a period of fear in the market. Analysts predict that the crypto space could experience a bullish run in Q4 2024, especially as institutions begin ramping up investments. This surge is likely to coincide with potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve [source](https://coinspeaker.com).\n\n\nStay tuned as we continue to monitor these exciting developments and how they shape the future of the crypto industry.\n\n",
